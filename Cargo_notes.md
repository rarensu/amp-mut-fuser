1.  **Information I was hoping to find:** Yes, I see `edition = "2024"`. This confirms why the build failed earlier. The environment's Rust compiler is too old. The user mentioned that it compiles, so they must be using a newer toolchain. I see a `rust-toolchain` file in the root, which probably specifies the correct version. I also see `async-std` and `tokio` as optional dependencies, which is interesting for my `JulesFS` that might need multithreading.

2.  **New questions:**
    *   What are all these `abi-7-*` features? It looks like they are for different FUSE ABI versions. How do I know which one to use?
    *   What's the difference between the `async-std` and `tokio` features? Which one should I use for a multithreaded filesystem?

3.  **Next file to read:** The user explicitly told me to start with `README.md`. So I will read that next. After that, I'll check `rust-toolchain`.

4.  **Weak points:**
    *   The `Cargo.toml` itself is fine. However, a comment explaining the `abi-*` features would be helpful for a newcomer.
    *   It's not immediately clear what the `default` features are (it's empty).

### Further Reflection

My initial analysis of `Cargo.toml` was straightforward and largely correct. The key takeaways about the Rust edition and the async features were accurate. The questions I raised were good starting points for my exploration. There is not much to add here, as my understanding of this file was not significantly challenged by later revelations. The core purpose of this file is to define the project's metadata and dependencies, and my understanding of that was sound.
