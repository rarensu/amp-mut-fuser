1.  **Information I was hoping to find:** Yes, this is very helpful! It explains the three different `Filesystem` traits: `trait_sync`, `trait_async`, and `trait_legacy`. It explicitly recommends `trait_sync` for most new filesystems, but I'm interested in multithreading, so `trait_async` sounds more like what I need for `JulesFS`. The "Available APIs" and "Feature Gates" sections are particularly useful. The "Concepts" and "Subdirectories" sections give me a good mental map of the project.

2.  **New questions:**
    *   The `README` says `trait_sync` is for single-threaded applications, and `trait_async` supports both single- and multi-threaded. What's the real-world trade-off? Is `trait_async` much harder to use?
    *   The `README` mentions that the `examples` directory contains several filesystems, but many still use the legacy API. It would be great to see an example using `trait_async`.
    *   The `threaded` feature is on by default. Does this mean even a `trait_sync` filesystem will use multiple threads for I/O? The description says "threaded i/o".
    *   The `README` mentions `AnyFS` as glue code. How does that work? It seems important for understanding how the different `Filesystem` traits can be used interchangeably.

3.  **Next file to read:** The `README` has given me a good overview. I think reading `src/lib.rs` is the next logical step to see how everything is tied together at the top level of the crate. It will probably expose the main modules and give more insight into the public API. After that, I'll dive into `src/trait_async/filesystem.rs` to understand the async API.

4.  **Weak points:**
    *   The documentation is quite good, but it could be improved with a small example for `trait_async`. The current minimal example is for `trait_sync` and it's commented with `ignore`, which is not ideal.
    *   The "macOS (untested)" section is a bit concerning. It would be good to know the current status of macOS support.
    *   The relationship between the `threaded` feature and the different `Filesystem` traits could be explained more clearly.

### Further Reflection

My initial reading of the `README.md` was a good starting point, but it led me to a major incorrect assumption. The `README` mentions `AnyFS` as "glue code", which I interpreted as some form of adapter. This sent me down a rabbit hole of trying to find an in-crate adaptation mechanism (like a blanket trait implementation).

The reality, as I now understand it, is that `AnyFS` is a simple enum, and the `Session` handles each variant natively. There is no "glue code" in the sense of an adapter; the glue is simply the `match` statement inside the `Session`'s dispatch logic.

This is a key point that the `README.md` could clarify. A sentence like "`AnyFS` allows the `Session` to natively handle any of the three filesystem traits, dispatching to the correct implementation at runtime" would have saved me a lot of time and confusion. My struggle to understand this is a strong signal that the documentation at this point, while good, can be improved to prevent future contributors from making the same mistake.
