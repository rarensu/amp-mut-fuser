1.  **Information I was hoping to find:** This was the file I read to confirm my (incorrect) theory about the blanket implementation. I was looking for default methods that called `self.dispatch`. I found them, which seemed to confirm my model.

2.  **New questions:** At this point, I thought I had solved the puzzle. My only remaining question was how the mutability would work for the sync trait, but I was confident there was a solution.

3.  **Next file to read:** I had planned to stop exploring at this point, as I thought I understood the architecture.

4.  **Weak points:** The documentation in this file was sparse. It didn't explain the role of the `dispatch` method or that the default implementations all delegate to it. This lack of documentation was a contributing factor to my confusion.

### Further Reflection

This file was the final, confirming piece of my incorrect mental model. Finding default methods that called `dispatch` was the "proof" I was looking for.

The reality is that this file is only relevant for *actual* legacy filesystems. The new `sync` and `async` filesystems are handled by separate logic paths within the `Session` and do not interact with this trait at all (unless an external adapter is used).

My assumption that this trait was the "base" trait for everything was wrong. It's just one of three co-equal trait implementations that the `Session` can handle.

This highlights the importance of the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file. Without a high-level overview, a developer is likely to latch onto the first plausible explanation they can find, even if it's wrong. The fact that the code *could* be interpreted in the way I did shows that the architecture, while clean, is not self-evident from the code alone.
