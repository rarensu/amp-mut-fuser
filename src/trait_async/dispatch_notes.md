1.  **Information I was hoping to find:** Bingo! This is the missing piece. The `dispatch` function takes the request and a `Reply` object. Inside the `match` statement, it calls the async method on the filesystem trait (`fs.lookup(...)`), which returns a future. Then, it uses `FS::Runtime::block_on` to run the future to completion. When the future completes, it gets the `Result` and calls the appropriate method on the `Reply` object (`reply.entry()` or `reply.error()`). This explains everything! The `AnyFS` implementation of the legacy `Filesystem` trait calls this `dispatch` function, which in turn adapts the call to the async trait. This is a very clever design.

2.  **New questions:**
    *   The `dispatch` function is not part of any trait. It's a free function in the `dispatch` module. How is it called? I remember `any.rs` calling methods like `fs.init(req, reply)`. But `trait_async::Filesystem` doesn't have an `init` with that signature. There must be a blanket implementation of `trait_legacy::Filesystem` for types that implement `trait_async::Filesystem`. This blanket implementation would then call the `dispatch` function.

3.  **Next file to read:** `src/trait_async/mod.rs`. I need to find the blanket implementation that connects `trait_async::Filesystem` to `trait_legacy::Filesystem`.

4.  **Weak points:**
    *   This is where the magic happens, and it's not documented at all. A developer trying to understand the code would be very confused at this point (like I am). A comment in `any.rs` or `trait_async/dispatch.rs` explaining the adaptation layer would be immensely helpful. For example: "Note: `trait_async::Filesystem` has a blanket implementation of `trait_legacy::Filesystem` which uses this dispatch function to adapt the async methods to the callback-style API."

### Further Reflection

This note captures the moment I thought I had found the "missing piece". My analysis of the `dispatch` function's role was correct in principle: it's the bridge between the async world and the callback world. My error was in assuming *how* it was called. I invented the blanket implementation to make my mental model work.

The reality is that this `dispatch` function (or rather, the `dispatch_async` method on `RequestHandler` that I saw later) is called directly by the `Session` when it encounters an `AnyFS::Async` variant. There is no trail of `dispatch` calls through a blanket implementation.

This note is valuable because it shows exactly how a developer can be misled. The idea of a blanket `impl` is so idiomatic in Rust that it seemed like the obvious solution. The documentation needs to be very clear that the `Session` handles the dispatch natively, to prevent others from falling into the same trap. The comment I later added to this file serves this exact purpose.
