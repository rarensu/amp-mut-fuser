# Notes on `src/any.rs`

## First Impression

- **The "Aha!" Moment:** This file is the key to understanding the entire unified API architecture. The `AnyFS` enum is a brilliant and simple solution for holding any of the three filesystem trait implementations (`Legacy`, `Sync`, or `Async`). Seeing this makes the design of the `Session` struct immediately click into place.
- **Clever Generics and `From` Traits:** The use of the `_Nl`, `_Ns`, and `_Na` placeholder structs, along with the corresponding `From` trait implementations, is very impressive. The comment calling it "Compiler trickery" is helpful and accurate. This pattern allows a user to provide just their one filesystem implementation and have it seamlessly converted into the correct `AnyFS` variant without any boilerplate. It's an elegant piece of API design that prioritizes user experience.
- **Missing `run` Method:** Based on the user's hints, I was expecting to find a `run` method here that would `match` on the enum variant and call the appropriate trait-specific function. However, no such method exists in this file. This leads me to believe that the dispatch logic for the *run methods* must be on the `Session` struct itself.

## Summary

This file is a fantastic example of using Rust's type system to create a clean and powerful abstraction. It's the cornerstone of the new API design. The only minor point of confusion is that the `run` method I was looking for is not here, which directs my attention back to `session.rs` as the likely place for that logic. This is another good example of how a small, slightly inaccurate hint can lead a developer on a (short) chase.
