1.  **Information I was hoping to find:** Yes, this file is the crate root and it gives a good overview of the module structure. I see `trait_sync`, `trait_async`, and `trait_legacy` as public modules. I also see the `mount2` function which seems to be the main entry point. The example code uses a `Filesystem` trait that doesn't seem to be any of the three new ones. It seems to be the legacy one. The doc comment says "The `Filesystem` trait is generic over the threading model", which is a bit confusing given the three separate traits mentioned in the `README.md`.

2.  **New questions:**
    *   The example in `lib.rs` uses `fuser::Filesystem`, but the `README.md` and the module structure suggest that I should be using `fuser::trait_sync::Filesystem` or `fuser::trait_async::Filesystem`. Which one is it? Is `fuser::Filesystem` a re-export of one of them?
    *   The `mount2` function takes an `AnyFS`. The `README.md` mentioned this. How is `AnyFS` constructed from my filesystem struct? The `where` clause `AnyFS: From<FS>` suggests some kind of conversion. I'll need to look at `any.rs`.
    *   What is `Channel` that is returned by `mount2`? The docs say it can be used to "communicate with the filesystem". What does that mean?

3.  **Next file to read:** I have a few options.
    *   `src/any.rs` to understand `AnyFS`.
    *   `src/trait_async/filesystem.rs` to understand the async API that I'm interested in.
    *   `src/session.rs` to understand how `mount2` works.

    I think `src/any.rs` is the most critical right now to understand how the different filesystem traits are handled. After that, I'll go to `src/trait_async/filesystem.rs`.

4.  **Weak points:**
    *   The example in `lib.rs` is confusing. It seems to be using the legacy API, but it's presented as the main example. It should probably be updated to use `trait_sync::Filesystem` and match the `README.md`'s recommendation. Or better yet, have examples for all three.
    *   The doc comment for the `Filesystem` trait in the example is misleading. It says "The `Filesystem` trait is generic over the threading model", but the `README.md` clearly states there are three different traits. This should be clarified.
    *   The `TODO` comments are helpful, but it would be even better if they were linked to GitHub issues.

### Further Reflection

My confusion about the example in `lib.rs` was a major driver of my incorrect architectural assumptions. The example used `fuser::Filesystem`, which I correctly identified as the legacy trait. This, combined with the `AnyFS` "glue code" concept, led me to believe that everything was adapted *to* the legacy trait.

My plan to update the example in `lib.rs` to use the modern traits is still valid and, in fact, even more important now. The crate root documentation should absolutely showcase the recommended, modern way of using the library. The confusing example was a significant source of misunderstanding, and fixing it is a high-priority documentation improvement. The key insight is that `fuser::Filesystem` should not be the trait that new users reach for first. The path should be `fuser::trait_sync::Filesystem` or `fuser::trait_async::Filesystem`.
