# Notes on `src/trait_sync/run.rs` (Final Look)

## First Impression

- **The Engine Room:** This file provides the concrete `impl` block for `Session` that contains the `run_sync` method. This is the heart of the execution logic for the synchronous API.
- **Work in Progress:** The code is more complex than I first imagined, with different methods for a simple request loop (`do_requests_sync`) versus a full event loop (`do_all_events_sync`). The comments, especially `// TODO: multithreaded`, make it very clear that this is an area of active development. This is important context for any contributor.
- **The Final Link:** The `handle_one_request_sync` method contains the call to `req.dispatch_sync(...)`. This is the final piece of the puzzle, connecting the session loop to the operation-specific dispatch logic.

## Points of Feedback

1.  **Code in Transition:** The `TODO` comments and the sketched-out but commented-out multi-threading logic clearly indicate this code is not considered final. This reinforces the overall sense that the crate is in a state of major transition, which is a key piece of information that should be communicated in the `README`.
2.  **Clear Internal Logic:** The separation of concerns within this file is good. Splitting the simple request loop from the more complex event loop that handles notifications and heartbeats makes the code more modular and easier to reason about.
3.  **The Journey's End:** Arriving at this file after following the logical trail from `Session` and `AnyFS` provides a complete and satisfying understanding of the architecture. The design itself is logical, but the path to understanding it is not straightforward for a newcomer.

## Summary

This file is the final destination in the journey to understand the synchronous API's execution flow. It's a well-structured implementation that clearly shows how requests are read and dispatched. The main feedback point is that the "work-in-progress" nature of this file should be reflected in the project's overall documentation to manage contributor expectations. Now that I have seen this, my understanding of the end-to-end process is complete.
