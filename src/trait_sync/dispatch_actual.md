# Notes on the actual `dispatch_sync` logic

(Found in the content of `src/trait_sync/run.rs`, but this is the real dispatch logic for the synchronous API)

## First Impression

- **This is the correct dispatch logic:** This code is exactly what I was looking for. It contains a comprehensive `match` statement that maps each low-level FUSE `Operation` to the corresponding method on the new `Filesystem` trait.
- **Clear and Idiomatic Design:** The pattern used here is excellent. For each operation, it calls the filesystem method, receives a `Result`, and then passes that `Result` to a dedicated method on a `replyhandler`. This is a clean, robust, and easy-to-understand way to handle request processing and response generation.
- **`RequestHandler` is a good abstraction:** The choice to implement this logic as a method on a `RequestHandler` struct is very effective. It neatly bundles the request's data, metadata, and the reply mechanism into a single, cohesive unit.
- **Smart State Management (`&mut FS` vs `&self`):** The dispatch function takes a mutable reference to the filesystem (`&mut FS`), while the trait methods it calls take an immutable reference (`&self`). This is a subtle but powerful design that allows for state management at the session level while still promoting thread-safe implementations for individual FUSE operations.

## Questions

1.  **Who calls `dispatch_sync`?** Now that I understand the dispatcher, the next piece of the puzzle is to find where it's called from. I assume it's invoked by a central request processing loop, likely located in `src/session.rs`.
2.  **The `ReplyHandler`:** The `replyhandler` provides a very clean abstraction for sending replies back to the kernel. I'm curious to see its definition, which I presume is in `src/reply.rs`.
3.  **The File Confusion:** The most pressing issue remains the file organization. Finding this crucial piece of logic was confusing due to the misleading file names and locations (`trait_sync/dispatch.rs` containing legacy code, and this logic appearing in the content of `trait_sync/run.rs`). This is a major finding that should be addressed to improve the codebase's clarity.

## Next File to Read

To get the final piece of the puzzle, I need to see where `dispatch_sync` is called. I will use a search tool to find its call site. After that, I'll have traced a request all the way from the kernel to the filesystem implementation and back. My next action will be to **`grep` for "dispatch_sync"**.
