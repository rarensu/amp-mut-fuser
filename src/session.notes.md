# Notes on `src/session.rs` (Second Look)

## First Impression

- **The Central Hub:** This file is clearly the heart of the unified API. The `Session` struct, with its generics and its `filesystem: AnyFS<...>` field, is the component that brings all three APIs together.
- **The Missing `match`:** The `run` and `run_blocking` methods contain the high-level dispatch logic I was looking for. The `match &self.filesystem { ... }` statement is the key that directs execution to the correct trait-specific run loop (`run_legacy`, `run_sync`, `run_async`).
- **Clean Architecture:** The separation of concerns is excellent. This file defines the `Session` data structure and the high-level dispatch logic. The actual implementations of the run loops are located in their respective `trait_*/run.rs` files as extension `impl` blocks on `Session`. This is a very clean and maintainable way to structure the code.

## Points of Feedback

1.  **Documentation Needs an Overview:** The documentation for `Session` would be greatly improved by explicitly stating that it is a unified struct for all three API types and briefly explaining its relationship with the `AnyFS` enum. This would give new developers the architectural context they need right from the start.
2.  **Panic in `run()`:** The `run()` method panics if it encounters an `Async` filesystem. While the comment provides a good hint, relying on a runtime panic for this is not ideal in a library. A better approach might be to remove the `run` method entirely, forcing the user to make a conscious choice between `run_blocking` and `run_async`, which would make the control flow more explicit.
3.  **The Path of Discovery:** The intended logical flow (`mount2` -> `Session` -> `run` -> `match` -> `run_sync`) is sound, but it's not documented. A new developer has to piece this together on their own, which is difficult given the other points of confusion in the codebase. An architectural overview in the `README` or `lib.rs` would solve this.

## Summary

With the context of `any.rs`, the design of `session.rs` is no longer confusing; it's elegant and powerful. It's the linchpin that holds the different APIs together. The main feedback is to make this excellent design more discoverable through documentation.
